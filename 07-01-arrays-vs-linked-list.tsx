// if you want to store 1000 items in an array
// you have to allocate all of that memory upfront

// when you create a linked list
// it has nothing
// you create the first node
// if you want to add something you create another node and link them
// the memory usage is more optimised
// but there is a difference of runtime cost

// with the array its constant so the speed of access is fast

// with a linked list you need to traverse it to find something
// it's always a linear search on a linked list

// so can we do array access with the ability to grow?
