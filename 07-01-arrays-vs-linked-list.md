### Arrays vs Linked List

Lets contrast these

- Usability
- Time
- Space (whiteboard)

### Questions?

### Can we do better?

- Can we have an array access with the ability to grow?

### Yes!

if you remember from the array section I did say we have the ability to write
in list operations using an array.
