### A L G O R I T H M \_ T I M E

This second algorithm is a bit of a doosy, but its definitely a basis for other
algorithms we will encounter.

### Is it ordered?

Lets say it is this time. So how can we search this array?

### First, lets come up with our own algorithm together

First Try?
First Whiteboard

### Another Big O trick

If the input halves at each step, its likely O(LogN) or O(NlogN)

### This is Binary Search

One of the greatest algos ever!

### Lets implement it

To the typescripts!

- dont forget to divide by 2

### Questions?
