### Yes! Sorting!

Yes, it wouldn't be an algorithm course without at least a couple sorts! I
know... we will implement a sorting algorithm (actually 2 of them).

### BubbleSort

Yes, lets do bubble sort. Usually the first algorithm in almost every major
source is insertion sort, but I find it so boring! Lets do bubble!

As my teacher once said...

To the whiteboard!

### So what's the running time?

back to the whiteboard!

### Depending on the time, we will implement this...

To the typescript! or to the next part!

### There are other sorting strategies I want to talk about but...

There is more sorting algorithms to deal with, and we will, but we haven't
covered recursion, so we will hold off.

### Questions?

- Only one time have i ever had to implement a sorting algorithm.
