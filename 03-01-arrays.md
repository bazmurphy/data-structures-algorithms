### Array

Yes. Array. I know you are all thinking... "but i know this."

### Well... you also said const a = []

hurts. sorry.

### if const a = [] isn't an array, what is it?

Well by the end of this section we can empirically tell what it is.

### Lets first just play with arrays.

First a moment on the whiteboard.
Then to the node!

### So lets talk about arrays. (white board time)

Covering: Lets practice our BigO!!!

- What are arrays
- Getting at specific index
- Insertion at specific index
- Deletion at specific index

### Arrays

They are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks

- That means you cannot grow it
- There is no "insertAt" or push or pop. Doesn't mean you can't write those
  though

### Questions?

Any questions at this moment? We have pretty much covered _what an array is_.

### Searching for a value?
