### Why start with LinkedLists?

They are so foundational to programming concepts when it comes to DSA.
Understanding them will help you with trees, with graphs, etc etc.

### Is it a Data Structure or Algorithm?

Well... now we get into philosophy. Is what we are going to see next an
algorithm on a linked list or is it its own data structure?

### Queue

This is probably the most common data structure that i have implemented in many
languages.

!to the white board!

### Running Time

(whiteboard)

- enqueue
- deque
- peek

### We entering a world of DSA where constraints make things fast

You will notice pretty much from here on out that what makes a lot of these
datastructures fast is the lack of features.

### Lets implement!

To the Typed JavaScripts

### What's the opposite of a Queue?

Oddly enough, i have also created these A LOT when doing performance things.

whiteboard time!

### Running Time

(whiteboard)

- push
- pop
- peek

### Constraints are great!

Again, notice the constraint made it fast

### If there is time

lets impl!

### Questions?
