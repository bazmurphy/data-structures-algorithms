### BST

The binary search tree. A classic when it comes to learning about trees.

#### The thing about them

They are not some _new_ ds that we haven't seen, they are specifically an
ordering to the data within the data structure.

### Lets program them, but first whiteboard the algorithm

- Find
  - Running time?
- Insertion
  - what does this do to running time?
- Deletion
  - Trickier than you thought? O Y E S

### Lets write binary search!

- Just the search part (its super easy)

### Lets compare

Binary search an array vs a tree?

- What feels easier to implement?
