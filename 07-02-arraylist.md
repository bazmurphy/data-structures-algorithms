### This a pretty cool DS

This combines the idea of an array with the ability to grow it. Adheres to the
list interface.

### ArrayList

Lets talk about it on the whiteboard

### Running Time

- Get
- Deletion/Insertion at beginning of list
- Deletion/Insertion in the middle
- Deletion/Insertion at end of list

### Implementation!

(timecheck: day1, afternoon)
To the (neo and the one true)vim!

### Which one is better?

- if you haven't made the observation yet, ArrayLists operate best when treated
  like a stack

## Interview tip

(your answer should always be it depends)
When I am interviewing less experienced individuals, this is something I really
like to hear explained in one form or another. Why would you use one thing over
another.

### I think you have had enough...

but there is one more list you should at least know about

### Ring Buffers

I have literally created at least 10 of these this year...

Lets whiteboard the behavior out.
